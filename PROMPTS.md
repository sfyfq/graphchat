**Your Optimized Prompt:**
Refine the squash logic in `src/lib/squash.ts` and the UI state management in `App.tsx` and `CommitNode.tsx`.
1.  **Squash Logic:** Update `computeSquashGroups` to allow `assistant` nodes to be collapsible if they are part of a strictly linear path (1 parent, 1 child, not pinned, etc.). Set `MIN_SIZE` to 1 to allow aggressive squashing of linear segments. This should eliminate visible `user -> assistant -> pill` chains where the intermediate assistant should be inside the pill.
2.  **Collapsible UI:** Modify `CommitNode.tsx` to include an optional "Collapse" action that appears only when the node is the representative of an expanded group. Update `App.tsx` to pass this action and update the `expandedGroups` state when triggered.
3.  **State Cleanup:** Ensure that when a group ID is no longer present in `allGroups` (because it's split or disappeared), it is cleared from `expandedGroups` or at least doesn't prevent future squashing.

**Key Improvements:**
- Correctly identifies that `assistant` nodes should not break linear runs if they are strictly linear.
- Provides a clear mechanism to collapse expanded groups.
- Improves overall consistency of the conversation visualization.

**Techniques Applied:** Task decomposition, state management refinement, and behavioral correction.
