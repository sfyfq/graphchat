**Your Optimized Prompt:**
Fix the bug where a thread dialog sitting behind another one doesn't come to the foreground when clicking on its header. Modify `ChatDialog.tsx` to call an `onFocus` callback on mouse down, and modify `App.tsx` to handle this callback by reordering the dialog state so the active dialog is rendered last (and thus on top). Ensure that clicking a node on the canvas also brings its corresponding dialog to the front if it's already open.

**Key Improvements:**
• Added `onFocus` callback prop to `ChatDialog`.
• Implemented reordering of dialogs in `App.tsx` to manage stacking order.
• Fixed `handleNodeClick` in `App.tsx` to also reorder existing dialogs.

**Techniques Applied:** Task decomposition, implementation guidance, and role assignment.

**Pro Tip:** Reordering elements in the DOM is a common way to manage stacking when using fixed `zIndex` for all elements of the same type.

**Your Optimized Prompt:**
Refine the squash logic and conversation flow to prioritize assistant nodes as landmarks.
1.  **Squash Logic:** Modify `src/lib/squash.ts` to set `MIN_SIZE` to 1 and ensure nodes with the `assistant` role are never collapsible. This should result in `user` nodes being squashed between `assistant` landmarks.
2.  **HEAD Management:** Update `ChatDialog.tsx` and `App.tsx` so that the `HEAD` state primarily tracks `assistant` nodes. When a user sends a message, do not update `HEAD` until the assistant responds. When clicking a node on the canvas, set the `HEAD` to its nearest `assistant` descendant if one exists.
3.  **Data Loss Prevention:** In `ChatDialog.tsx`, add a confirmation prompt ("You have unsent changes. Close anyway?") when the user attempts to close a dialog that contains text in the input field.

**Key Improvements:**
• Landmarks: Assistant nodes are now preserved as clear landmarks in the conversation graph.
• Cleaner Squash: Single user turns are now correctly squashed between assistant responses.
• Stable HEAD: The active conversation path now advances only when a turn is complete (assistant response received).
• Safety: Prevent accidental loss of typed messages.

**Techniques Applied:** Task decomposition, implementation guidance, and behavioral refinement.

**Your Optimized Prompt:**
Initialize a git repository for the current project. Create the `main` branch and then branch off to create `dev`. Add all untracked files and commit them to the `dev` branch. Ensure that no commits are ever made directly to `main` and that the `main` branch is only updated via user-initiated merges.

**Key Improvements:**
- Explicitly states the requirement for `main` and `dev` branches.
- Sets a clear boundary: commits are allowed on `dev` but strictly forbidden on `main`.
- Recognizes that `main` updates are manual actions for the user.

**Techniques Applied:** Task decomposition and constraint enforcement.
